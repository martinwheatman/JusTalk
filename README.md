# JustTalk - A Vocal Web Driver

Just Talk is a keyword interpreter which is directed at Web intereaction.
These keywords help the user invoke the actions of a browser.
In keeping with speech act thheory, there are informative replies to 
reassure the user that the appropriate action has been performed.
In many ways is it like Tery Winograd's Blocks world program, SHRDLU, 
but it interacts with a web page of widgets rather than a tray of blocks.
Specifically, interaction is with the Document Object Model.
This means that it is not necessarily interacting with the web page HTML, 
but with the document as built.
Much of the code, therefore, is aimed at working around the document as injected 
by the web page, and by the visual elements of layout:
e.g. ignoring the header and footer code!

## To install

Go to the Chrome extensions webside, and add this to your browser.

# [so] what commands [are there]

Commands are given as string-literal verb-phrases, interspersed with noun-phrase variables.
So the keyword search \[guesses-at-meanings] currently include:
- click on X
Where X is the 'name' of the button. Following the specification for clickable items, this is either the title, value, innerText or the 'submit' button.  Radio buttons and checkboxes are not supported yet.

Similarly, the page reader included the commands:
- read .. from X
- read .. from the main heading

Text and text areas are managed with the commands:
- set the value of X to Y
- get the value of X

Describing the page, there are several commands:
- describe the page
- how many X are there
- how do I \[navigate|interact|query]
- what buttons are there

## Notes

- You'll need Chrome for the moment, I'm afraid.
If there's anyone out there in webland who knows a bit about manifests and can make 
this work on Firefox (etc.), please feel free to get in touch/fix.
- you'll need to manually allow the microphone access to each page you visit.
