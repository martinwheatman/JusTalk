# JustTalk
Just Talk - A Vocal Web Driver

This is a chatbot which is directed at Web intereaction.
Specifically, interaction with the DOM.
This means that this is not interacting with the web page as served, 
but the conceptual document as built.

#What is a chatbot?
In this instance, the intention is not for the software to engage the user
in a conversation, so why do I call it a chatbot?
Weizenbaum's ELIZA (see CACM, 1966), which formed the basis for chatbots, 
works on a keyword searh, and provides an appropriate reply (selected from one of
several stock replies) aimed at provoking the user to enter further utterances,
in a Rogerian analysis.
Here there are keywords, but the actions are directed - more like Winograd's SHRDLU.

#What commands are there?
So the keywords currently include:
    read .. from XXX
    read .. from .. main heading ..
