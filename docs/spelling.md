## Spelling!
Speech-to-text software is remarkable at interpreting natural language, particularly when there is a longer series of words uttered.
However, we still need to be able to specify the spelling of words because, ultimately, we are nat able to determine how the software interprets what we say.

JusTalk includes *phonetic spelling* e.g., "click on the mail spelt mike alpha lima echo radio button", because "Mail" might be returned as "Male".
This not only is processed by JusTalk after it is returned from the speech-to-text software, it also provides a longer stream of words which should help the speech-to-text software.

The phonetic alphabet is:

        "alpha",  "bravo",    "charlie", "delta",  "echo",    "foxtrot",
        "hotel",  "golf",     "india",   "juliet", "kilo",    "lima",
        "mike",   "november", "oscar",   "papa",   "quebec",  "romeo", 
        "sierra", "tango",    "uniform", "victor", "whiskey", "x-ray",
        "yankie", "zulu"
